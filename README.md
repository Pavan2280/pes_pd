#### QFN-48 Package
The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-Lead 48) package is a widely used integrated circuit (IC) package in the electronics industry. It belongs to the family of leadless surface-mount 
packages designed to maximize space efficiency on printed circuit boards (PCBs) while providing excellent thermal performance and electrical connectivity.
The QFN-48 package typically consists of 48 pins arranged in a square or rectangular grid. The pins are numbered and positioned along the package's perimeter.

#### Chip
The chip is centrally positioned within the package, as illustrated in the image below, depicting the method of connection between the chip and the package.By connecting the chip in this manner, we can efficiently transfer signals from the external world into the interior of the chip.

# Components of Chip
- Pads : Pads serve as conduits for transmitting signals both into and out of a chip, facilitating bidirectional communication between the chip's internal and external components.
- Core : The core essentially serves as the central region where various digital logic components, including AND gates, OR gates, multiplexers (mux), and other types of logic elements, are located.
- Die : It essentially defines the dimensions or physical size of the chip.
- IP's : IP refers to pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or modules that can be integrated into a semiconductor chip's design. These blocks typically encompass a wide range of functions, such as processors, memory, communication interfaces, and specialized functions.

# What are PDK's
PDK stands for "Process Design Kit." It is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation used in the semiconductor industry for designing and verifying the manufacturing process of integrated circuits (ICs) or microchips. PDKs are essential for semiconductor companies, foundries, and design houses to create and optimize semiconductor devices.
