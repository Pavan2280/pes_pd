# QFN-48 Package
The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-Lead 48) package is a widely used integrated circuit (IC) package in the electronics industry. It belongs to the family of leadless surface-mount 
packages designed to maximize space efficiency on printed circuit boards (PCBs) while providing excellent thermal performance and electrical connectivity.
The QFN-48 package typically consists of 48 pins arranged in a square or rectangular grid. The pins are numbered and positioned along the package's perimeter
